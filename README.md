# shorten-url
Creating short URLs.

I created a new repo under my ownership, with the work that Curt, Richard, and I did together under https://github.com/cpoff/shorten.

This is a site that will accept a URL, assign a string of letters & numbers to it, and then hyperlink the original URL to that string as a short URL.

For each URL, we also have a counter that increments each time the short URL is accessed from the shortener site.
